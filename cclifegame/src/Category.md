# Scenario and Ending Category
## This is a guide to all the scenario categories.
<p>
In the parenthesis are the nicknames for the categories.<br>
They will be used in sorting and randomDraw in the main game.<br>
The first priority ending categories only applies to the endings and not the scenarios,
since that would result in immediate ending of the game.
C1-3 applies to both ending and scenarios.<br>
The 2nd category will be the category to draw from when the game is running (stats>0 && block<32). <p>

<p>The standard used for "low" is 25.
In general, the value modification when any resource is low should be subtle.
This is to avoid sudden death.</p>
