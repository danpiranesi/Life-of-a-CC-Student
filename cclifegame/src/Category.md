# Scenario and Ending Category
## This is a guide to all the scenario categories.

In the parenthesis are the nicknames for the categories.
They will be used in sorting and randomDraw in the main game.
The first priority ending categories only applies to the endings and not the scenarios,
since that would result in immediate ending of the game.
C1-3 applies to both ending and scenarios.
The 2nd category will be the category to draw from when the game is running (stats>0 && block<32).


The standard used for "low" is 25.
In general, the value modification when any resource is low should be subtle.
This is to avoid sudden death.
